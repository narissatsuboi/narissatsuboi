## About 
I'm a **MSc of Computer Science student at Seattle University** 📚 in Washington, USA. I've been making the career change into software development since January 2021 when I started the Seattle U Computer Science Fundamentals Certificate. 

My background before computer science is in civil engineering and building systems engineering  🏗️. I continue to work as a construction engineer while I work toward my career change into software development. You can see my career trajectory on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/narissat/)✨.
